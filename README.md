# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly, resulting in unexpected styling behavior.  The issue involves a section of code where specific Tailwind classes are used, but the corresponding styles do not render in the browser.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and the solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Bug Description
A simple div element with several Tailwind CSS classes is expected to display specific styles (gray background, padding, shadow). However, these styles are not being applied, despite the classes appearing to be correctly used.

## Possible Causes
* **Incorrect Configuration:** Problems with Tailwind's configuration or installation.
* **CSS Specificity:** Conflicting styles from other CSS rules might override Tailwind classes.
* **Typographical Errors:** Simple typos in class names could prevent them from working.
* **Missing or Incorrect Imports:**  Failure to properly import or include Tailwind's CSS.
* **Caching Issues:** Browsers or build tools may cache old CSS, preventing updates from being applied. 

## Solution
The solution addresses the underlying cause of the issue and demonstrates how to correct it.  Review `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
